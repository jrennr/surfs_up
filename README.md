# Title: Statistical Analysis of Weather Data for June and December in Hawaii

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The purpose of this statistical analysis is to compare the weather conditions in June and December in Hawaii. We analyzed the temperature data from a local weather station to identify any significant differences between the two months. The analysis provided insight into the seasonal variations in temperature, allowing us to understand the climate patterns in these months.

### Results:
1.	Differences in Weather Between June and December:
-	Temperature: The average temperature in June is higher compared to December. This is shown in the summary statistics. There is a higher mean temperature in June.
-	Temperature Variability: In June, the temperature tends to have less variability with a smaller standard deviation compared to December. December has more temperature fluctuations, as indicated by its higher standard deviation.
-	Outliers: December has more temperature outliers and extreme values that deviate significantly from the mean, compared to June. This suggests that unusual weather events are more likely to happen in December.

## Summary:
Based on the statistical analysis of weather data for June and December, we observed several differences in temperature and temperature variability between the two months. June generally experiences higher average temperatures with less variability, while December has lower average temperatures with greater variability and more extreme temperature values.
Conclusion:
